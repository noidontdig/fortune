        The Code Cooperative is an open source educational program
        that teaches coding as a means to creating social change.
        We are partnered with <a href="http://fortunesociety.org">The Fortune Society</a>,

      <h2>-- Donate --</h2>
      <p>
        Access to a computer and the Internet is crucial to
        learning to code, which is why we are seeking laptop
        donations from tech companies. Laptops would
        be donated to the Fortune Society (100% tax-deductible).
