## Today's Objectives

* Be able to Build an HTML web page on JSBin
* Be able to use Google to search for how to build new things
* Be able to use common mouse actions and keyboard shortcuts

## 1. Mouse Actions & Keyboard Shortcuts

Use your new [Mouse & Keyboard Cheat Sheet](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1UOMz_OIV-_0t3QbzyZT4qJePwiG84mh83X-pvQRrjOE)
to take note of the actions you regularly take with your mouse and keyboard.

The mouse and keyboard are two of the programmer's most important tools, so
we should all work towards mastering them.

## 3. HTML Scavenger Hunt

Using JSBin, add the following to a new webpage:

1. A numbered (ordered) list of the best boroughs in NYC
2. A bulleted (unordered) list of your favorite restaurants
3.  A list of links to your 3 favorite websites
  * The links should all be clickable
4. A link that, when selected, will launch an email program and send an email with:

  * Your email address as the recipient
5. Your favorite song or poem, formatted with line breaks

## 4. Your first website - Your personal profile page

Using JSBin, create a new webpage: your personal profile page.

You can use [Facebook's profile page](https://www.facebook.com/zuck) for inspiration.

Requirements:
* Images
* Links to your favorite sites
* A list of your hobbies
* A list of your favorite places to eat
* Facts about your family history or your early life

You can add anything you'd like to share!

## 5. Build a Wikipedia page

[Wikipedia](http://wikipedia.org) is the free online Enyclopedia. It is one of the most popular
websites on the Internet, and it is an incredibly important tool
for sharing information.

Taking for inspiration [Martin Luther King Jr.'s Wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martin_Luther_King_Jr.),
build a Wikipedia page about a social issue you care about.
This page should have enough information needed for
people who know nothing about the issue to be able to learn and talk about it.

Potential topics:
* The 2016 Elections
  * Healthcare
  * Education
  * Unemployment
  * Gender Equality
  * The Environment & Climate Change
* The North Dakota Access Pipeline
* The 2016 Prison Strike
* Black Lives Matter
* Anything you care about!

Requirements:
* Easy to read
* Table of contents at the top that links to each section
* List of sources at the bottom
* Images
* Links to outside sources
* Include quotes from other sources
* At least 6 different HTML tags
  * For example: p, h1, h2, a, ul, li
