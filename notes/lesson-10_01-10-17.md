## 2. Installfest! (20 min)

1. Download & Install Google Chrome: https://www.google.com/chrome/browser
2. Download & Install Sublime Text https://www.sublimetext.com/3
3. Create a folder in your home directory called `code`. This is where all your websites will live.

## 3. Building a Website with Sublime Text

Create a new folder for your website called `helloworld`. You will create a new folder for each new website.

Create a file called **`index.html`**. This is the entry point of every website.

Add the following starter code to `index.html`:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <title>My first website</title>
  </head>
  <body>

  </body>
</html>
```

The starter code above is the BASIS of any website. In detail:
* `<!DOCTYPE html>` specifies that this document (or file) is of type HTML.
* `<html>...</html>` sepcifies the beginning and end of your HTML file
* `<head>...</head>` defines "invisible" information about your website
  * For Google search, or other robots
  * Links to external CSS stylesheets, or JavaScript code
* `<title>...</title>` defines a title for the website
  * This is an "invisible" title. Not to be confused with "header"
* `<body>...</body>` defines the "visible" body of the website
  * All the code you want the user to be able to see should go in here

### A. Exercise: Build a "New Year's Resolutions" page

Using the starter code above, add some code to the `<body>` to list your 2017 New Year's Resolutions:
* Use an `<h1>` tag for the page header: "Alex's New Year's Resolutions"
* List at least 3 resolutions

Challenge:
* Use `<ol>` or `<ul>` to list your resolutions
* Add images that will inspire you to complete them
* Add links to resources that will help you complete them
* Add a motivation song that plays automatically when you load the page

### B. [Challenge] Exercise: Add CSS to your website

Use Google search to find out how to add an external CSS stylesheet to your website!

Hint: You will have to create a new file, that will have a name ending in `.css`.
