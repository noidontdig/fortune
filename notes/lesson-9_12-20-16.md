# Lesson 9 - Building Beautiful Layouts with HTML & CSS (continued)

* Date: 12.20.16

## Today's Objectives

* Be able to use HTML spans & divs, and CSS positioning to build layouts
* Be able to use Google to search for how to build new things

## 1. Do Now (10 min)

Prepare for your website demo:
* The demo should be 3 min long, and answer the following questions:
* What problem did you choose to solve?
* How does this website help sove the problem?
* List 1-3 new things you learned in order to build this website.
* What was the most challenging part?
* List 1-3 things you would like to change/add to your website.

## 2. Building Layouts with HTML & CSS

### A. `<span>` and `<div>`

* [w3schools lesson](http://www.w3schools.com/html/html_blocks.asp)

#### (1) `<div>` & block elements

A block-level element always starts on a new line and takes up the full width available (stretches out to the left and right as far as it can).

```
The <div> element is a block-level element.
```

Examples of block-level elements:
* `<div>`
* `<h1>` - `<h6>`
* `<p>`

#### (2) `<span>` & inline elements

An inline element does not start on a new line and only takes up as much width as necessary.

The `<span>` element is an inline element and can be placed inside other elements.

Examples of inline elements:
* `<span>`
* `<a>`
* `<img>`

**`<div>` and `<span>` elements both define a section on the webpage, they simply follow different rules.**

### B. CSS classes

* [w3schools lesson](http://www.w3schools.com/cssref/sel_class.asp)

A **class** allows us to style certain HTML elements differently from the rest.

A class allows us to name an HTML element (p, h1, a, div), and refer to it in our CSS:
* To name or classify an element, we add the `class` attribute to its HTML tag.
* To refer to a class in CSS, we preface the class with a `.`

You can think of **classes** as **names** for HTML elements.

For example, if I want to style all my paragraphs a certain way, except for a particular paragraph, I can do the following:

```html
<p>This is a normal pagragraph</p>

<p>This is another normal paragraph</p>

<p class="special">This is a special paragraph</p>
```

```css
p {
  color: black;
  font-size: 16px;
}

.special {
  color: red;
  font-size: 20px;
}
```

### C. CSS layout properties

#### (1) `width` & `height`

* [w3schools lesson](http://www.w3schools.com/css/css_dimension.asp)

The `height` and `width` properties are used to set the height and width of an element.

```css
div {
  height: 100px;
  width: 500px;
  background-color: powderblue;
}
```

#### (2) `margin` & `padding`

* [w3schools lesson: Margins](http://www.w3schools.com/css/css_margin.asp)
* [w3schools lesson: Padding](http://www.w3schools.com/css/css_padding.asp)
* [w3school lesson: Box model](http://www.w3schools.com/css/css_boxmodel.asp)

The CSS `margin` properties are used to generate space around elements.

The margin properties set the size of the white space **outside** the border.

```css
div {
  margin-top: 100px;
  margin-bottom: 100px;
  margin-right: 150px;
  margin-left: 80px;
}

div {
  margin: 100px 150px 100px 80px;
}
```

The CSS `padding` properties are used to generate space around content.

The padding clears an area around the content (**inside the border**) of an element.

```css
div {
  padding-top: 50px;
  padding-right: 30px;
  padding-bottom: 50px;
  padding-left: 80px;
}

div {
    padding: 50px 30px 50px 80px;
}
```

The box model:

<img src="../images/box-model.png" width="400">

#### (3) `display`

* [w3schools lesson](http://www.w3schools.com/css/css_display_visibility.asp)

**The `display` property is the most important CSS property for controlling layout.**

The display property specifies if/how an element is displayed.

Every HTML element has a default display value depending on what type of element it is. The default display value for most elements is `block` or `inline`.

However, you can override this. Changing an inline element to a block element, or vice versa, can be useful for making the page look a specific way.

```css
a {
  display: block;
}
```

#### (4) `position`

* [w3schools lesson](http://www.w3schools.com/css/css_positioning.asp)

The `position` property specifies the type of positioning method used for an element.

There are four different position values:
* `static`
* `relative`
* `fixed`
* `absolute`

Elements are then positioned using the `top`, `bottom`, `left`, and `right` properties. However, these properties will not work unless the position property is set first.

```css
div.fixed {
  position: fixed;
  bottom: 0;
  right: 0;
  width: 300px;
  border: 3px solid #73AD21;
}
```

### D. Example: the German flag

Let's build the following layout in JSBin:

<img src="../images/germany.png" width="300">

### E. Example: the Colombian flag

Let's build the following layout in JSBin:

<img src="../images/colombia.gif" width="300">

## 3. Exercise: Flags! (1 hr)

Using the concepts above, build the following countries' flags:

* Germany
* Colombia
* Thailand
* France
* Japan
* Sweden
* Philippines
* Jamaica
* Greece
* Brazil
* USA
* Or, choose your favorite flag!

**Reminders:**
* Use Google to find out what the flag looks like
* Use w3schools color picker to find the right colors
* All your flags should be on the same webpage
* Use Google to find out more about CSS positioning
  * Remember: Ask yourself, then Google, then a friend, then Alex!

## 4. Exercise: What about your website? (10 min)

Now that youâ€™ve learned more about creating visual layouts with
HTML and CSS:
* List 3 changes you can make to your website to make it more visually appealing
* Optionally, draw your updated design on a piece of paper

## 5. Homework

1. Using the skills you learned today, build on the layout of your site to make it more visually appealing
2. Finish the flag exercise
3. Practice typing on http://www.keybr.com
4. Finish the [Codecademy HTML & CSS course](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/web)
