## 3. Build Your Own Website

Using the HTML & CSS skills you've learned over the past
lessons, build a website that solves a problem.

### Plan

Spend ~20 minutes planning your website:
* Choose a problem you would like to solve
  * This can be big or small: a website that informs the public about their rights, a website that lists all the restaurants within walking distance of your home
  * Something related to the work the Fortune Society does
  * Something related to the results of the 2016 elections
  * Something that would help your family members
* Design a website that would help solve this problem
  * Answer the following question: **What is the goal of my website?**
  * Design the simplest possible version of your website (Minimum Viable Product) on a piece of paper
  * Make sure every element on your website design ladders up to the main goal
  * It should be simple enough that you can build it with the knowledge you already have (HTML & CSS)

### Build
