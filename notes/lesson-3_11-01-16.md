## Today's Objectives

* Be able to Build an HTML web page on JSBin
* Be able to add element styling to HTML web pages using CSS
* Be able to use Google to search for how to build new things
* Be able to use JSBin to write and test code

## 1. Do Now (15min)

* Go to www.jsbin.com and sign in
* Create a new web page with the following:
  * 1 header with the name of your favorite singer/actor/athlete/celebrity `<h1>`
  * 2 images of them `<img>`
  * 1 paragraph (2 sentences) about them `<p>`
  * 1 paragraph (2 sentences) about why they matter to you `<p>`
  * 1 link to their website/twitter/facebook `<a>`

## 2. Adding style to our HTML with CSS!

### What is CSS?

We use HTML and CSS to build websites.

CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheet.

HTML gives our content structure, and **CSS** gives our content **style**.

CSS works with HTML, but **is not** HTML.

A piece or chunk of CSS is called a **CSS rule**.

### CSS Rules

A CSS rule has a **selector**, and **property - value** pairs.

```css
selector {
  property: value;
  property: value;
  property: value;
}
```

For example, if I want to make all paragraphs blue with larger text, I might write:

```html
<p>I wish this text were more colorful</p>
```

```css
p {
  color: blue;
  font-size: 40px;
}
```

**A pixel (px)** is a unit of measure for a computer display.

## 3. CSS Scavenger hunt

Add the following to the website you just built:

* Give all images a border of 1px
* Make every h1 25px and orange
* Underline every link in red
* Make every paragraph Arial or, if not available, san-serif
* Make every paragraph italicized, with 16px bold text and san-serif font
* Give images a round border

## 4. Your first website - Your personal profile page WITH STYLE

**Add style to your personal website!**

Using JSBin, create a new webpage: your personal profile page.

You can use [Facebook's profile page](https://www.facebook.com/zuck) for inspiration.

Requirements:
* Images
* Links to your favorite sites
* A list of your hobbies
* A list of your favorite places to eat
* Facts about your family history or your early life

You can add anything you'd like to share!

## 5. Build a Wikipedia page - WITH STYLE

**Add style to your wikipedia page!**

[Wikipedia](http://wikipedia.org) is the free online Enyclopedia. It is one of the most popular
websites on the Internet, and it is an incredibly important tool
for sharing information.

Taking for inspiration [Martin Luther King Jr.'s Wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martin_Luther_King_Jr.),
build a Wikipedia page about a social issue you care about.
This page should have enough information needed for
people who know nothing about the issue to be able to learn and talk about it.

Potential topics:
* The 2016 Elections
  * Healthcare
  * Education
  * Unemployment
  * Gender Equality
  * The Environment & Climate Change
* The North Dakota Access Pipeline
* The 2016 Prison Strike
* Black Lives Matter
* Anything you care about!

Requirements:
* Easy to read
* Table of contents at the top that links to each section
* List of sources at the bottom
* Images
* Links to outside sources
* Include quotes from other sources
* At least 6 different HTML tags
  * For example: p, h1, h2, a, ul, li
